/**
 * The Graphics class contains a set of methods that you can use to create a
 * vector shape. Display objects that support drawing include Sprite and Shape
 * objects. Each of these classes includes a <code>graphics</code> property
 * that is a Graphics object. The following are among those helper functions
 * provided for ease of use: <code>drawRect()</code>,
 * <code>drawRoundRect()</code>, <code>drawCircle()</code>, and
 * <code>drawEllipse()</code>.
 *
 * <p>You cannot create a Graphics object directly from ActionScript code. If
 * you call <code>new Graphics()</code>, an exception is thrown.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Graphics class is final; it cannot be subclassed.</p>
